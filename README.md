- 👋 Hi, I’m @collindr
- 👀 I’m interested in technology that makes our carbon footprint smaller and making technology more accessible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS and Python, once I learn the basics I'm interested in learning Swift/Objective-C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet until I'm more confident in my skillset :)
